# chrome_dino_bot
This project automated the dino game on google chrome using python

# How it works
The program uses pillow library to grab an image infront of the dino. As an object appear in front of the dino, pyautogui will make the dino jump hence avoiding the obstacle. The bbox infront of the dino is set using coordinates.
